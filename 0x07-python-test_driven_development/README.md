# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
- Python \- UnitTests \- TDD

> Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not.
> Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements.

### Starting from today:

> Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
> The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
> We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
> Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
