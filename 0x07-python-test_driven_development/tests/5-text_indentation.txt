The text_indentation Module:

Import module
	>>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

Make Sure Documentation Exists:

    >>> module_documentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").__doc__
    >>> print(len(module_documentation) > 0)
    True

    >>> function_documentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation.__doc__
    >>> print(len(function_documentation) > 0)
    True

Correct Usage:

	>>> text_indentation("Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything: The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases? We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
